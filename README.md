A powerful script for DaVinci Resolve that integrates the Whisper speech-to-text model to automatically generate subtitles for your timeline. It supports both local high-performance transcription via `faster-whisper` and cloud-based transcription through the OpenAI API, with an optional AI-powered correction feature for superior accuracy.



## Project Features

- **Dual Transcription Modes**: Choose between local processing with `faster-whisper` (no internet required) or the highly accurate OpenAI API.
- **Multiple Models**: Supports all `faster-whisper` models (`tiny`, `small`, `base`, `medium`, `large-v3`) and OpenAI models (`whisper-1`, `gpt-4o-mini-transcribe`, etc.).
- **AI-Powered Correction (Smarter Mode)**: Utilizes a GPT model to intelligently punctuate and refine the transcription, delivering more natural and accurate subtitles.
- **Seamless Integration**: Runs as a simple script within DaVinci Resolve, no complex setup needed.
- **Automatic Workflow**:
    1.  Renders audio from your current timeline or a selected media clip.
    2.  Transcribes the audio using the selected engine.
    3.  Generates a standard `.srt` subtitle file.
    4.  Imports the SRT file directly into the first available subtitle track.
- **Customizable Output**:
    -   Set the transcription language or use auto-detect.
    -   Define the maximum number of characters per subtitle line.
    -   Option to remove time gaps between consecutive subtitles.
    -   Use a "Prompt" or "Hotwords" list to improve recognition of specific names, jargon, or technical terms.
- **Bilingual UI**: Switch between English and Chinese interfaces with a single click.
- **Cross-Platform**: Fully compatible with both Windows and macOS.

## Installation

1.  **Download the Project**:
    Clone the repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/2445868686/DaVinci-Resolve-Whisper.git
    ```

2.  **Run the Installer**:
    -   **On Windows**: Double-click the `Windows_Install.bat` file.
    -   **On macOS**: Double-click the `Mac_Install.command` file.
    
    The installer will automatically copy the script files to the correct DaVinci Resolve directory.

## Usage

1.  **Open the Script**:
    -   In DaVinci Resolve, go to the **Workspace** menu.
    -   Navigate to **Scripts** -> **Utility**.
    -   Click on **DaVinci Whisper** to launch the script window.

2.  **Configure Settings**:
    -   **Transcription Mode**:
        -   For local processing, uncheck "Use OpenAI API". Select a model from the dropdown. If you haven't downloaded the models, click **Download Model**.
        -   For cloud processing, check **Use OpenAI API**. Select a model and enter your API credentials.
    -   **Smarter (AI Correction)**: Check this box to enable AI-powered punctuation and refinement. This requires an OpenAI API key, even if you are using a local model for the initial transcription.
    -   **Language**: Select the primary language of your audio, or leave it as "Auto" for automatic detection.
    -   **Max Chars**: Set the maximum number of characters you want in a single subtitle line.
    -   **No Gaps**: Check this to make each subtitle start exactly when the previous one ends.
    -   **Phrases / Prompt**: Enter any specific words, names, or phrases (separated by commas) that you want the model to recognize more accurately.
